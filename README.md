# Predicting NBA Games Using Deep Learning

This project explores the use of deep learning models to predict NBA game outcomes using only pre-game team-level statistics. We evaluate logistic regression, random forest, stacking, XGBoost, a feedforward neural network, and a Transformer, comparing them across accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.

## Project Summary

- **Goal**: Predict win/loss outcomes using structured NBA data from Kaggle (2019–2024)
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Stacking, XGBoost, Neural Network, Transformer
- **Best Model (Accuracy)**: Tuned Neural Network (62.1%)
- **Best Model (AUC)**: Tuned Transformer (0.552)
- **Key Techniques**: Rolling averages, matchups, contextual features, keras-tuner optimization

## Downloads (Large Files)

All files are hosted externally due to GitHub's 25MB file limit. Some are available directly in the repo but all are available here for posterity.
